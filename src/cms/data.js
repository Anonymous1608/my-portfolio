  about: `
        Hello!! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aniket, a backend-focused developer with strong skills in Javascript, Nodejs, and Express Rest Framework, complemented by full-stack experience. I specialize in building reliable and scalable backend systems, while also working across the stack to create cohesive and engaging web applications.\n
        \n
        With over 2 years of professional experience, I have developed RESTful APIs, designed efficient database schemas, and implemented business logic, ensuring performance and security. On the frontend, I enjoy crafting responsive interfaces and delivering seamless user experiences. My goal is to build end-to-end solutions that not only solve problems but also delight users with intuitive design and smooth functionality.
        \n\n
        When I'm not coding, I stay engaged with industry trends, contribute to projects, and focus on growing my skills in microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes.
        \n
