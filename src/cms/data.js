  about: `
        Hello!! 👋 I'm Aniket, a passionate Full Stack Developer with strong expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Next.js. I thrive on building comprehensive web applications that seamlessly integrate powerful backends with dynamic, user-centric frontends.\n
        \n
        With over 2 years of professional experience, I handle the complete development lifecycle — from designing efficient database schemas and scalable RESTful APIs to crafting responsive, modern user interfaces. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and ensuring high performance and security across every layer of the application. My goal is to deliver polished, end-to-end solutions that solve real-world problems and provide exceptional user experiences.
        \n\n
        When I'm not coding, I stay engaged with industry trends, contribute to open-source projects, and constantly expand my skillset in microservices, Docker, and cloud technologies.
        \n
